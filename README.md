Extracting LOL PCS data with Python

The jupyter notebook is scraping data from the official website of PCS https://www.lolpcs.com/stats.php?Lan=1, to get the data of Pacific Championship Series 2021 Spring.

The Notebook is in 2 parts:
1. Scrape Hero Ban, Pick and Win rate data and save it into 3 different CSV,
2. Scrape players' statistics and save them into CSV.

Next step:
1. Modify the codes into a function,
2. Add scraping code for 3rd partys' tournaments data.
